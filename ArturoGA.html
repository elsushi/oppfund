	<h3>I wanted to create a short post for you to read more about me</h3>

	<p>This is me:</p> <br>
	<div class= "yo"><a href="http://imgur.com/9Xg4vFm"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9Xg4vFm.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></div>
	<div class="subt"><p>Hello...</p></div>
	<br>
	<p>
		My previous experience is in banking, I used to work for Citigroup as a Team Leader for the operations team in the Corporate Clients Division (fun stuff, right?). Even though it 
		was a great opportunity for me to develop my career as a banker, I decided that it just wasn't for me; I was 
		constantly trying to improve all the processes in order to make them simpler for our clients and for my team. 
		Sadly, there was a lot of red tape to go through and it was very difficult to actually make a change; that's 
		when I decided that I needed to look for something else, I needed a different experience... <br><br>

		Fortunately, I was accepted for an MBA at Hult IBS in London in 2012, this experience was simply a life 
		changing experience. I got to meet awesome new people, it broadened my view of the world, and it also made me 
		realize the importance of creating businesses that stand out from the competition. <br><br>

		After graduation, I decided to enroll at Makers Academy, in their web development program, during these 12 
		weeks I learned more than ever, it showed me the satisfaction of building something on your own and it also 
		allowed me to see some of the awesome stuff that tech startups are building up in London.

	</p>


	<div class="q1"><h3>So, you're kind of an entrepreneur, right?</h3></div>
	
	<div class= "a1"><p>
		Yes, I would like to start a company at some point.
	</p></div>

	<h3>So... why design then?</h3>
	<p>
		I've always been interested in design, I truly believe that it is essential nowadays to stand out from 
		competition, we are always in contact with design even if we donâ€™t realize it, and I guess that when we don't 
		realize it is because we're using something that is well-designed, it's only when we find out that something 
		bad designed is affecting us that we realize of the importance of design. 
	</p>

	<h3>And UX design?</h3>
	<p>
		User experience design, is necessary nowadays, everyone who has build an interactive website has been a UX 
		designer, maybe a bad one, or maybe they're just naturals, but it is something that needs to be recognized, 
		and I also think that it will only become more important in the future, simply because everything is becoming 
		more interactive and more people is become engaged in digital services.<br><br>

		Additionally, I think good UX design improves people's lives, it allows them to have simpler and easier 
		experiences that allow them to focus on what they really want and that will only help improve the world, 
		which I think is awesome.


	</p>

	<h3>Ok, so we've read your story, but why should you be picked for the scholarship?</h3>
	<p>

		I know that I'm not a designer (yet), I don't have a portfolio and I might seem like a not so obvious choice 
		for you, but I believe I have some other strengths that could help me stand out. First, I have a business 
		background, which I believe is very helpful, since UX designers need to understand what the entrepreneurs are 
		trying to achieve, so I would be able to act as a mean to translate the idea of the business into a UX design 
		that would leave everyone happy (win-win!). Additionally, I have web development skills, which I consider to 
		be a great asset for a UX designer, even though I'm not a pro yet, I'm always practicing and I believe it 
		would help me to put my designs into a screen. Having these skills also made me realize that I'm more of a 
		designer than of a developer. <br><br>

Also, as I told you before, I'm constantly trying to make things work better, since my banking days, I was 
continuously trying to improve the inner processes, whether I'm on the street or surfing the web, I'm always 
thinking about different ways to improve things, and make everything just work better. I guess I have always been 
in the path of becoming a UX designer. <br><br>

Finally, I'm highly motivated; I love learning, and I'm reading constantly about UX and searching around for new 
articles, I want to be more prepared and succeed, my international experience has also allowed me to learn the 
different ways people think around the world. I truly believe that I can become very good at this

	</p>

	<h3>So, let's say we give you the grant, how would you give back to community?</h3>
	<p>
		As I told you before, I live in Mexico City, where the tech scene is just starting, so my plan to give back 
		to community would be to teach more people about UX design whenever I can, I have always thought that if 
		there are more of us, everything will improve at a faster pace and people will become more aware about it. I 
		really want to help make a change.
	</p>

	<h3>How do you feel about being part of an underrepresented group in tech?</h3>
	<p>
		I really don't see it as something that has stopped me from trying to develop my career, I just think of it 
		as another challenge I have to tackle. Having said that, I'm deeply grateful for the existence of programs 
		like the opportunity fund.
	</p>

	<h3>Anything else you want to tell us about?</h3>
	<p>As I said before, I'm highly motivated and I know that an opportunity like this would really help me to 
		become a UX designer and to succeed in the future, so I hope you consider me to be part of your course. I 
		truly believe that I can become very good at this</p>

	<p>Thanks!</p>

	<p>*Fun Fact: I've lived in 4 continents (Mexico City, London, Shanghai, and Sydney)</p>
